## DevOps | AWS | Data Engineering
Developer interested in creating services that improve people’s lives. While I truly enjoy dissecting problems in detail and being thorough in the work, I’m driven to learn, and transmit my knowledge to others. Former analyst in Auto1 Group, built our team's data warehouse over DBT and currently under training in a DevOps program, centered in AWS, Linux, Docker & Jenkins.
